# Roadmap

Tracks the current phase of work so a new session (after `/clear` or a fresh
start) can pick up where the last one left off without re-deriving context.
Update this file - don't just say the plan out loud in chat - whenever the
phase changes.

## Phase 0 - Incident response & hardening (done, 2026-08-03)
- Recovered from the broken `/data` mount that wiped the database (absolute
  volume path fix, `aims-backup` sidecar, HBS3 off-NAS backup, startup guard).
- Security/stability audit: response headers, rate limiting, DB index,
  confirmed no dead code / SQL injection / auth gaps.
- UX polish: favicon/manifest/404, responsive tables on mobile, compact
  dates, venue+Maps links, trophy case runner-up/third place.

## Phase 1 - Test suite (done, 2026-08-03)
Added a `pytest` suite in `tests/` (19 tests, `py -m pytest` from repo root -
`requirements-dev.txt` adds `pytest` on top of `requirements.txt`):
- Auth gates (`login_required`/`admin_required`/`society_required`/
  `invite_required`) actually block unauthenticated and under-privileged
  access - `tests/test_auth_gates.py`.
- `import_csv.py` / `export_csv.py` round-trip, plus the re-import-never-
  regresses-a-moderator-set-review rule - `tests/test_import_export_roundtrip.py`.
- The 27/28 unconfirmed-tier blanking rule in `import_csv.py` -
  `tests/test_import_unconfirmed_tier.py`.
- The trophy-case query (win/runner-up/third-place counts) -
  `tests/test_trophy_case.py`.
- The startup guard (missing-db warning) and the mount-path (`AIMS_DB_PATH`)
  assumption - `tests/test_startup_guard.py`.
Sanity-checked by temporarily disabling the admin-role check and confirming
`test_admin_required_blocks_non_admin` actually fails - the suite catches
real regressions, not just passing by construction.

## Phase 1.5 - Feature/UX polish (done, 2026-08-03)
A long session of smaller, mostly independent asks rather than a single
sweep - each planned/tested/shipped separately:
- **Society pages**: a "Future announced show" block split out of the main
  history table (and a follow-up fix - it was invisible on desktop, wrapped
  in a mobile-only CSS class); "Tier" renamed to "Section" everywhere
  Gilbert/Sullivan is shown (display text only, no column/data renamed).
- **Invite codes**: switched from random `AIMS-XXXXXX` codes to two
  dictionary words (e.g. `silver-otter`), case-insensitive login; a
  suggested-code prefill + "Suggest another" on `/admin/invite-codes`;
  delete + bulk-cleanup of the old `AIMS-` codes; a "generate/reveal this
  society's login code" panel right on the society's own public page
  (admin-only) - faster than the general invite-codes page for handing a
  code out on request.
- **Email notifications**: a new show submission or feature suggestion now
  emails a fixed inbox in real time (`app/notify.py`, stdlib SMTP, inert
  until `SMTP_USER`/`SMTP_PASSWORD` are set - see docs/deployment.md).
- **Homepage poster gallery**: now derived directly from the "Upcoming
  shows" list (same shows, same region filter, soonest first) instead of a
  separate query - a past show's poster no longer lingers there once
  there aren't enough upcoming posters to fill the row.
- **Society profile**: a society can now add an "about/get involved" blurb
  plus Website/Facebook/Instagram/TikTok/Other links from their own
  self-service login, shown on their public page. Every URL is validated
  to start with `http(s)://` before saving (it lands in a public `<a
  href>`, so a `javascript:`/`data:` URL is rejected outright, not just
  escaped).
- Test suite grew from 19 to 40 tests across this work; all pushed and
  live via Portainer "Pull and redeploy".

Parked, not started: a dedicated historical-posters browse page (scroll
through every poster ever uploaded, not just upcoming ones) - flagged as
"a big effort," worth its own planning pass when picked up.

## Live user feedback backlog (started 2026-08-04)
The site is live and has real (anonymous) users submitting shows and
feature requests - Phase 3's planned "fresh session + LAUNCH.md spec" never
formally happened, it just launched organically. Worth circling back to
that conversation at some point (onboarding all ~150 societies rather than
word-of-mouth, edge cases, what "done" means), but for now this is a running
backlog triaged from a batch of anonymous feature requests Darragh collected.

**Round 1 - quick wins (in progress):**
- "Current season" nav/page renamed to reflect that it browses any season,
  not just the current one.
- Bulk-add-shows form gets venue + production team columns (currently
  season/show/dates only).
- Copy-ready login-code text on the society-page code panel (from
  Phase 1.5's "generate/reveal a society's code" feature).
- Moderator/admin login moved out of the main nav to a footer link.
- Fix: submitting a show via the public form when a blank "TBA" placeholder
  already exists for that society+season creates a *second* row instead of
  filling in the placeholder (natural key is `society + season + title`, and
  a blank title vs. a real one don't match) - needs manual cleanup every
  time. Submission should fill in the existing placeholder when one exists.

**Round 2 - suggestions system rebuild (next):**
- `feature_suggestions` gets a `category` (Bug fix / Feature / Data
  correction) and a richer `status` (New -> Planned -> In Progress -> Done /
  Not planned), both admin-set from `/admin/suggestions` - the public
  submission form itself stays simple.
- A new public page lists triaged suggestions (status != New) with their
  category/status, so someone can check "has this already been suggested/
  actioned" before submitting a duplicate.
- An *optional* contact field on the submission form (nothing like this is
  collected today) - lets Darragh personally follow up with someone when
  their suggestion ships, entirely manual/his choice, not automated.

**Round 3 - homepage split (mockup first):**
Darragh's stated priority - split the current single homepage into a
landing page (blurb / news-or-changelog section / upcoming shows) and a
standalone `/societies` browse page. Needs a mockup before any code, per
the working agreement below.

**Parked for their own dedicated sessions:**
- Stats page "shows by season" redesign - explicitly wants mockup variants,
  flagged as "the ugliest page so far."
- A society-page section for costume/prop rental listings, ideally matched
  to shows the society has actually performed - the biggest lift on the
  list (new data model, new admin UI, a matching concept), not a quick
  add-on.
- A staging/test environment separate from production, so a bad change
  can't hit the live site directly - scope still to be discussed (what's
  actually prompting this, and how far to take it given the NAS/Portainer
  setup).

## Phase 2 - Data integrity sweep (next)
- [Pending: run `export_csv.py` against production](see Claude's memory -
  "pending-csv-export-refresh") to pull the North Wexford tier fix (and
  anything else manually corrected since) back into the tracked CSVs.
- Audit for other societies with similarly stale/presumptive data.

## Phase 3 - Public launch
**Reality check (2026-08-04): the site is already live and has real
anonymous users** - this happened organically rather than through the
formal process below. The interview/`LAUNCH.md` step is still worth doing
at some point (scaling onboarding to all ~150 societies, edge cases, what
"done" means), just retroactively rather than as a gate before launch.

Before announcing this to AIMS societies/fans at large:
- Start a **fresh session** for this phase specifically.
- Have Claude interview you with `AskUserQuestion` about launch scope,
  onboarding at scale (how do all ~150 societies actually get invite codes -
  not just the ones who happen to ask), edge cases, and what "done" means.
- Write the outcome to `LAUNCH.md` as a real spec before implementing
  anything further.

## Phase 4 - Post-launch maintenance cadence
- Periodically verify the nightly backup (`aims-backup` sidecar) is still
  actually producing files, not just running.
- Revisit deferred items from the security audit: CSP (blocked on inline
  `onsubmit` handlers), real image-content validation for poster uploads
  (would need Pillow).

## Working agreements (from the 2026-08-03 process review)
- `/clear` (or a fresh session) between genuinely distinct workstreams -
  don't chain unrelated incidents/features/audits in one long thread.
- Mockup-first for anything visual - already working well, keep doing it.
- For a sweep touching many files (like Phase 0's audit), write the plan
  and get sign-off before editing, rather than fixing things as found.
- Lessons that matter beyond one session go in `docs/`, not just chat -
  already the habit for this repo, keep it up.
